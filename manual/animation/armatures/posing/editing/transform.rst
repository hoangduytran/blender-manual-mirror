Transform
*********

In *Pose Mode*, bones are transformed similarly to objects in *Object Mode*.
The standard transform operators (Move, Rotate, Scale, and others) are available
from :menuselection:`Pose --> Transform`, but they operate within the armature's
hierarchy and each bone's local space.


Bone Parenting
==============

Bone transformations are evaluated relative to the armature's rest pose and are
affected by :ref:`bone parenting <bpy.types.EditBone.parent>`. Transforming a
parent bone also affects all of its children.


Transform Center
================

The default pivot point for a single selected bone is its root.

When multiple bones are selected, most pivot point modes use the median point of
the selection. The *3D Cursor* pivot instead uses the position of the 3D Cursor.


Local Space
===========

In the armature's rest pose, every bone has a location and rotation of zero and
a scale of ``1.0``. Transformations in *Pose Mode* are applied relative to this
rest pose using each bone's own local coordinate system.

   The displayed local axes are drawn relative to the armature's origin,
   while each bone is transformed in its own local space.

Using local axis constraints allows each selected bone to rotate around its own
axes independently. For example, pressing :kbd:`R Y Y` rotates the selected
bones around their individual local Y axes, making it easy to twist multiple
bones at the same time.
